Smart Metro System
In this era of modernisation dealing with time complexity is the most combursome task.Everyone is so busy in their own life.
In the Metro Cities like Delhi,Kolkata,etc metro is the lifeline of day-2-day transportation.Token and Queue create a lot of problems and waste a lot of time and
also use lot of plastics which are very harmful to our environment, so what if we provide solution for all these problems.

Our modern Metro System enables the passengers to just travel without worrying about tokens, cards, queue and so on. Sounds interesting? Lets explore it.

1. We are marking all our daily passengers with a simple registrion. The users will require to register themselves with an app only once and transfer money in it's special wallet via online
 money transfer.
2. Once the payment is made, the host will reflect the money in each user's account.
3. Whenever the user travels from one station to another, the system will use face recognition embedded with deep learning algorithm. For trial run, we are running it via openCV face 
   detection feature.
4. Once the system identifies the face of passenger,(it will be done on a gate from where a passenger passes one by one simultaneosly, deep learning algorithm will run the code efficiently 
	for sure), it will send the boarding and arrival point to the server.
5. The server will manipulate the data and deduct the money directly from the wallet of person.

Future Prospects:
1. Those people who wear naqabs will be provided with the traditional token facility at one counter.
2. If a passenger exceeds the distance than the money in his/her wallet, he will be provided with an e-challan to compensate it.
3. Every minor passenger's (below 18 years) travel history will be accessible to his/her guardian.


Advantages of this system :
1. Time-efficient: This would save hours of time for daily commuters who sand in queue at stations like Rajeev Chowk and will avoid stagnation of mob at one place.
2. Survelliance: The host will be having details of each and every passenger and it will facilitate crime management bodies to keep a check on suspects as his travel history is accessible
	for them.
3. Further, a city like New Delhi reguires 20 million tokens each day, this system would put an end to token systems further avoiding plastic and a bright step towards cleen and green 
	environment.
